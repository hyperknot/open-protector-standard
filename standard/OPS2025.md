# Open Protector Standard 2025 (OPS2025)

**Version:** OPS2025 (Classes S and M)  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 0. Introduction and Normative Language

The Open Protector Standard 2025 (OPS2025) is a supplementary technical standard for evaluating paragliding harness back protectors.

OPS2025 is designed to be used on top of the existing EN 1651:2020 impact pad test infrastructure, using the same core lab equipment and methodology (drop tower/release mechanism, drop height definition, anvil/landing surface, and dummy system), with the additions and clarifications defined in this standard.

While EN 1651 provides the baseline apparatus and test methodology, OPS2025 introduces:

- Weight range certification at two weight endpoints, similar to paraglider certification.
- Additional impact locations along the spine (SB, LS, T12).
- Specific dummy postures for those locations.
- Additional evaluation metrics (peak positive jerk) using a fixed signal-processing method.
- Procedural distinction between single-use and multi-use applications.

### 0.1 Normative Language

In this document, the following conventions apply:

- **Must:** Indicates a mandatory requirement. Failure to comply leads to invalid certification.
- **Should:** Indicates a strong recommendation or industry best practice.
- **May:** Indicates a permissible option.

---

## 1. Scope and Classifications

### 1.1 Scope

This standard applies to back protectors intended for use in paragliding harnesses.

### 1.2 Classifications (S and M)

OPS2025 defines two certification classes. The manufacturer selects which class to certify under.

- **OPS2025-S (Single-use):** Intended for protectors that may require replacement of the energy-absorbing material after a significant impact (for example crushable structures).
- **OPS2025-M (Multi-use):** Intended for protectors designed to remain usable after repeated impacts (for example foam and airbags), subject to the OPS stress-test procedure.

The distinction between S and M is procedural: class M includes a required stress test prior to the measured drops.

### 1.3 Replaceable Vent/Valve Elements (Class M)

For vented airbags with a replaceable vent/valve element, the protector is considered eligible for OPS2025-M, provided:

- the **main protector unit** (the airbag/protector body) is the same physical unit throughout the class M test sequence, and
- only the **vent/valve element** may be replaced (no other replaceable subcomponents are permitted under this allowance).

---

## 2. Normative References

- EN 1651:2020 - Paragliding equipment - Harnesses - Safety requirements and test methods.

OPS2025 uses the test apparatus, drop mechanism, anvil, and procedural setup defined in EN 1651:2020, except where explicitly modified by OPS2025 (dummy posture/orientation, stress-test procedure, impact points, weight endpoints, and signal processing).

---

## 3. Terms and Definitions

### 3.1 Test Weight

**Test weight** is the total mass of the dropped assembly that compresses the protector during impact, including:

- the dummy system,
- the protector,
- and, if the protector is tested installed in a harness, the harness and any attached equipment mounted to the dummy for the drop.

*Example:* If the dummy weighs 50 kg, the harness weighs 7 kg, and the protector weighs 1 kg, the test weight is 58 kg.

_Note:_ OPS2025 uses the term "weight" because it is standard lab terminology in this field, although the controlled quantity is mass.

### 3.2 Certified Test Weight Range (wMin - wMax)

The certified range of test weights for which the protector has been evaluated. Both endpoints of the range are tested.

- **wMin:** Minimum certified test weight
- **wMax:** Maximum certified test weight

Certification equals tested weight: wMin and wMax must be the actual measured test weights used for the submitted measured drops, recorded to 0.1 kg in the certification report.

### 3.3 Clip-in Weight (CIW)

For consumer communication, **clip-in weight (CIW)** means the total mass of:

- pilot,
- harness,
- all carried equipment (ballast, instruments, reserve, etc.),

excluding the glider. This represents the operational loading a protector experiences during a crash.

### 3.4 Recommended CIW Mapping (Informative)

OPS2025 provides an informative mapping between test weight and clip-in weight intended for consumer communication.

Current guidance is:

W_test = 0.80 × W_CIW (*)

(*) but minimum 50 kg

This approximation accounts for leg-first impacts, where approximately 20% of mass is not directly loading the protector.

This mapping is not part of certification and may be revised by OPS updates/errata without affecting existing certifications, because certification is expressed only in test weight (wMin - wMax).

The minimum weight limit of 50 kg is to allow using the current equipment, which has a fixed 50 kg weight.

### 3.5 Maximum Pilot Height (hMax)

**hMax** is the maximum pilot height declared by the manufacturer, used to define coverage intent for the T12 region.

OPS2025 does not define a physical verification method for hMax coverage.

### 3.6 Acceleration Signal Convention

OPS2025 requires that the acceleration signal exported by the EN test equipment shows:

- approximately 0 G at rest (stationary), and
- approximately -1 G during free fall,

such that the primary impact creates a positive acceleration peak.

### 3.7 Stress Test (Class M)

A **stress test** is a sequence of unmeasured drops performed before measured drops for OPS2025-M to verify multi-use suitability.

### 3.8 Submitted Run

A **submitted run** is the single measured drop run per required condition that the laboratory includes in the OPS2025 certification report for compliance evaluation.

OPS2025 does not limit the number of non-submitted trials performed by the laboratory prior to selecting a submitted run.

---

## 4. Manufacturer Declarations, Labeling, and Sample Marking

### 4.1 Manufacturer Declarations

The manufacturer must declare:

- intended OPS2025 class: **OPS2025-S** or **OPS2025-M**
- the intended certified test weight range endpoints (**wMin** and **wMax**)
- maximum pilot height: **hMax**

### 4.2 Consumer Product Labeling

The consumer-facing label must include:

- OPS2025 class: **OPS2025-S** or **OPS2025-M**
- certified test weight endpoints (**wMin** - **wMax**), in kg
- maximum pilot height: **hMax**
- a **recommended clip-in weight range (CIW)**, clearly indicated as informative guidance derived from the current OPS mapping (Section 3.4).

Manufacturers may update the labeled recommended CIW range when OPS mapping guidance changes, without re-testing, provided the certified test weight endpoints remain unchanged.

### 4.3 Certification Sample Marking

The certification sample(s) submitted to the laboratory must be marked on the inner side of the protector with:

- **PointSB**
- **PointLS**
- **PointT12**

The manufacturer must provide enough information so the laboratory can mount the protector in the intended orientation.

_Note:_ Production units do not require SB/LS/T12 point markings.

---

## 5. Impact Points

All points are marked on the protector's spine centerline on the inner surface of the protector.

### 5.1 PointSB (Sacral/Sitting Bone)

**PointSB** is the classical EN-style sitting bone / sacral region impact point, as marked by the manufacturer.

### 5.2 PointT12 (T12 Vertebra)

**PointT12** is the impact point intended to represent the T12 vertebra region for the tallest supported pilot (hMax), as marked by the manufacturer.

### 5.3 PointLS (Lumbo-Sacral)

**PointLS** targets the lumbosacral junction (L5 - S1 region) without requiring an additional manufacturer-defined anatomical point.

**Definition (1/3 rule):** PointLS is located at one-third of the curved surface distance from PointSB toward PointT12, measured along the protector surface.

**Equivalent expression:** SB - ⅓ - LS - ⅔ - T12

**Validation Procedure:**

1. The lab identifies manufacturer marks SB and T12.
2. The lab measures the curve-following distance between SB and T12.
3. The lab calculates the geometrical LS point at 1/3 of the distance from SB.
4. If the manufacturer's marked PointLS is within ±2 cm of the calculated point, the manufacturer's mark is used.
5. If the mark is outside this tolerance, the lab must re-calculate the correct PointLS and perform the test at the calculated location.

---

## 6. Test Apparatus and Setup

### 6.1 Apparatus

The test apparatus (dummy system, release mechanism, landing surface/anvil, and drop-height definition method) must be the same as used for the laboratory's EN 1651:2020 impact pad test setup.

OPS2025 requires no modifications an apparatus prepared for the EN draft, other than making it possible to add weights.

### 6.2 Drop Height

Drop height must be **1.65 m**, using the laboratory's EN 1651:2020 measurement method and tolerances.

### 6.3 Conditioning / Environment

Samples must be conditioned per EN 1651:2020 requirements before testing.

### 6.4 Protector Configuration (Standalone vs. In-Harness)

OPS2025 may be performed either:

- with the protector installed in a harness, or
- as a standalone protector mounted to the dummy,

as agreed between manufacturer and laboratory.

The chosen configuration must be clearly stated in the certification report. If tested in-harness, the harness and attached equipment mounted to the dummy are included in test weight.

---

## 7. Test Procedure

### 7.1 Samples

#### 7.1.1 OPS2025-M (Multi-use)

- The same main protector unit must be used for the stress test and all submitted measured drops.
- For vented airbags with a replaceable vent/valve element, only the vent/valve element may be replaced during testing (Section 1.3). The main protector unit must remain the same.

#### 7.1.2 OPS2025-S (Single-use)

For OPS2025-S, the manufacturer may use:

- new physical samples, and/or
- replacement energy-absorbing elements,

as needed to complete the test matrix.

The manufacturer must supply sufficient samples and/or replacement elements to complete the test matrix.

### 7.2 Stress Test (Class M Only)

For OPS2025-M only, perform a stress test before any submitted measured drops:

- Perform 5 unmeasured drops from 1.65 m at wMax.
- Configuration for these 5 drops:
  - Impact point: PointSB
  - Dummy posture: SB posture
- Alignment requirements should match measured drop alignment to the extent practical.

No specific recovery time is required between stress test drops.

The stress test must be completed before any measured drops.

For OPS2025-S, this section is skipped.

### 7.3 Dummy Postures and Impact Alignment

#### 7.3.1 SB Posture (PointSB)

- Dummy posture: EN 1651:2020 sitting posture, 22.5° configuration as used in EN impact pad tests.

#### 7.3.2 LS Posture (PointLS)

- Dummy posture: torso/back plane at 45° to horizontal ("eyes 45° up" posture).
- Impact alignment: Centered on the LS mark.

#### 7.3.3 T12 Posture (PointT12)

- Dummy posture: Supine, lying flat on the back with the back plane parallel to the ground. Torso horizontal; impact perpendicular to upper back.
- Impact alignment: Centered on the T12 mark.

### 7.4 Measured Drops (Test Matrix)

Submitted measured drops consist of:

- 3 impact points: SB, LS, T12,
- at 2 test weights: wMin and wMax,

for a total of 6 submitted measured drop conditions:

- SB @ wMin
- SB @ wMax
- LS @ wMin
- LS @ wMax
- T12 @ wMin
- T12 @ wMax

### 7.5 Trials vs. Submitted Runs

- The laboratory may perform any number of non-submitted trials to achieve correct setup, alignment, and valid measurement.
- For OPS2025 compliance evaluation, the laboratory must provide one submitted run per required condition (Section 7.4).
- Failed attempts are not reported.

### 7.6 Recovery Time

No minimum or maximum recovery time is specified. Recovery timing may be chosen by the laboratory and manufacturer.

---

## 8. Impact Window Definition

OPS2025 evaluates peak acceleration and peak positive jerk during the first impact event.

### 8.1 Filtering Prerequisite

The impact window is determined from the filtered acceleration signal (see Annex A).

### 8.2 Impact Window Detection

1. Find the first time the filtered acceleration exceeds 3 G (start of impact).
2. Continue until the filtered acceleration returns below 3 G (end of impact).
3. Extend this window by 100 ms before the start and 100 ms after the end.
4. Clip to available recorded data if necessary.

This extended region is the impact window for all evaluation.

Only the first such event is used.

### 8.3 Evaluation Within Impact Window

Peak acceleration and peak positive jerk must be evaluated within the impact window defined above.

---

## 9. Pass/Fail Requirements

To achieve certification, all 6 measured drop conditions must meet the following criteria based on filtered data.

### 9.1 Peak Acceleration Limit

For each submitted measured drop, the maximum filtered acceleration within the impact analysis window must not exceed:

**42 G**

### 9.2 Peak Positive Jerk Limit

For each submitted measured drop, the maximum positive jerk within the impact analysis window must not exceed:

**J_LIMIT G/s**

Only positive jerk values are considered (jerk > 0).

_Informative rationale:_ OPS2025 focuses on rapid onset of loading (positive jerk) as the more relevant case for injury risk compared to unloading (negative jerk). The body tolerates force release better than force application.

J_LIMIT is work in progress and will be fixed as a single numeric value (Annex B).

---

## 10. Certification Report

The test laboratory must produce a certification report containing at minimum:

### 10.1 Identification

- Manufacturer name

- Pass/fail for the submitted run

### 10.5 Raw Data Delivery

For each submitted run, the laboratory must provide the raw time-series data as a machine-readable file (for example CSV), including at minimum:

- time
- acceleration channel (G)

# Annex A: Measurement and Signal Processing (Normative)

This annex defines the mandatory signal processing for OPS2025 evaluation.

## A.1 Sensor Attachment and Resonance Control

Sensors must be attached firmly enough to avoid self-resonance artifacts.

**Normative requirement:** The sensor attachment must be free from mechanical resonance artifacts. If periodic oscillation unrelated to impact dynamics is visible in the jerk signal, the measurement is invalid and cannot be used.

**Informative guidance:** Recommended resonance checks include:

1. With the dummy hanging at rest (no drop), strike the dummy body with a small hammer at various points and inspect the jerk signal for periodic oscillation.
2. Perform very low-height drops (a few centimeters) onto a hard surface and inspect for ringing in the jerk signal.

The laboratory is responsible for verifying and documenting absence of resonance before testing.

_Note:_ No amount of filtering can correct for a resonating sensor. If resonance is detected, improve the physical attachment before proceeding.

## A.2 Sampling Rate

- Minimum sampling rate: 1000 Hz.
- A constant sampling rate is required for filtering.

If the sensor produces variable-rate samples, the data must be resampled to a constant rate before filtering. The resampling method is not specified by OPS2025.

## A.3 Acceleration Filtering

The raw acceleration signal must be filtered using the CFC filters as defined by the ISO 6487 and [SAE J211/1](https://law.resource.org/pub/us/cfr/ibr/005/sae.j211-1.1995.pdf) standards.

CFC class: **75** (~150 Hz design frequency)

Reference implementation (Python):

```py
import numpy as np
from scipy.signal import butter, sosfiltfilt

def cfc_filter(x, sample_rate_hz: float, cfc: float):
    """
    CFC filter (SAE-style mapping): 2nd-order Butterworth lowpass per pass,
    applied forward+backward (zero-phase) => "phaseless 4-pole" magnitude.

    Inputs:
      - x: array-like samples
      - sample_rate_hz: sampling rate in Hz (e.g., 1000 or 20000)
      - cfc: CFC class (e.g., 60)

    Notes:
      - SAE vs ISO: change the constant if needed:
          SAE: f_design = 2.0775 * CFC
          ISO: f_design = (25/12) * CFC ≈ 2.0833333333333335 * CFC
    """
    # Inline CFC -> design frequency (Hz)
    f_design_hz = 2.0775 * float(cfc)

    x = np.asarray(x, dtype=float)

    # Design 2nd-order Butterworth as SOS (one biquad)
    sos = butter(N=2, Wn=f_design_hz, btype="low", fs=sample_rate_hz, output="sos")

    # Zero-phase forward/backward, no padding
    return sosfiltfilt(sos, x, padtype=None, padlen=0)
```



## A.4 Jerk Calculation

Jerk is calculated as the time derivative of the filtered acceleration signal using a Savitzky - Golay derivative filter:

- Polynomial order: 3 (cubic)
- Derivative order: 1
- Window size: **15 ms** (converted to samples based on sampling rate; adjusted to an odd integer if necessary)

The output jerk unit is G/s when the acceleration input is in G.

Reference implementation (Python):

```python
from scipy.signal import savgol_filter

def compute_jerk(filtered_accel, sample_rate, window_ms):
    window_samples = int(round((window_ms / 1000) * sample_rate))
    if window_samples % 2 == 0:
        window_samples += 1

    jerk = savgol_filter(
        filtered_accel,
        window_length=window_samples,
        polyorder=3,
        deriv=1,
        delta=1.0 / sample_rate,
        mode='nearest'
    )
    return jerk
```

## A.5 Reported Jerk Value

For OPS2025 evaluation:

- consider only positive jerk samples (jerk > 0),
- report the maximum positive jerk within the impact analysis window defined in Section 8.

## A.6 Definition of G

OPS2025 uses:

- 1 G = 9.80665 m/s²

## A.7 Units

- Acceleration: G
- Jerk: G/s

---

# Annex B: Work in Progress

This annex documents open items requiring further development before final standardization.

## B.1 Jerk Limit Value (J_LIMIT)

The peak positive jerk acceptance limit is to be determined empirically by:

1. Testing the Kortel Kanibal Race 2 and Ozone Exoceat protectors.
2. At 75 kg test weight. (To be updated to the average comp pilot's calculated value)
3. Using OPS2025 procedures and filtering.
4. Averaging the peak jerk values from both protectors.
5. Adding 5% for tolerance.

This establishes the threshold based on protectors with established safety records at realistic pilot weights.
