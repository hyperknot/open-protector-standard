# Open Protector Standard 2025 (OPS2025)

Version: OPS2025 (classes S and M)
Status: Draft

---

## 0. Introduction and Normative Language

The **Open Protector Standard 2025 (OPS2025)** is a supplementary technical standard for evaluating paragliding harness back protectors. It is designed to be used **on top of** the existing **EN 1651:2020 impact pad test infrastructure** (same lab equipment, same drop height, same landing surface/anvil, same release mechanism, same dummy system).

While EN 1651 provides the baseline apparatus and test methodology, OPS2025 introduces:

- **Weight range** on two weight points, like on paragliders.

- **Additional impact locations** along the spine (SB, M, T12).
- **Additional dummy postures** for those locations.
- **Additional evaluation metrics** (peak positive jerk), using a fixed signal-processing method.
- **Material durability assessment** (Multi-use verification).

---

- ### Normative Language

  In this document, the following conventions apply:

  *   **Must:** Indicates a mandatory requirement. Failure to comply leads to invalid certification.
  *   **Should:** Indicates a strong recommendation or industry best practice.
  *   **May:** Indicates a permissible option.

---

- ## 1. Scope and Categories

  This standard applies to back protectors intended for use in paragliding harnesses.

  ### 1.1 Categories

  Manufacturers must designate the protector under one of the following two categories based on material indicators.

  *   **OPS2025-S (Single-use):**
      Targeted at protectors using crushable, deformable materials (e.g., Koroyd, honeycomb structures).
      *   *Requirement:* Standard measurement procedure.

  *   **OPS2025-M (Multi-use):**
      Targeted at protectors using elastic or viscoelastic materials (e.g., Foam, Airbag.
      *   *Requirement:* Must undergo a mechanical stress test ("pre-warming") prior to measurement.

---

## 2. Normative References

This standard relies on the following reference:

- **EN 1651:2020** — Paragliding equipment — Harnesses — Safety requirements and test methods

OPS2025 uses the test apparatus, drop mechanism, anvil, and procedural setup defined in EN 1651:2020. Laboratories certified to perform EN 1651:2020 testing may conduct OPS2025 testing using their existing equipment without modification, except for dummy orientation and additional weight changes specified in this standard.

---

## 3. Terms and Definitions

### 3.2 Test weight
**Test weight** is the total weight of the dropped assembly that is compressing the protector during impact, including:

- the dummy system,
- the protector,
- and, **if the protector is tested installed in a harness**, the harness and any attached equipment mounted to the dummy for the drop.

**Example**: If the dummy skeleton weighs 50 kg and the harness weighs 7 kg, and the protector weights 1 kg, the test weight is 58 kg.

_Notes:_
- OPS2025 uses the term “weight” because it is standard lab terminology in this field, although the controlled quantity is mass.

### 3.3 Clip-in weight
For consumer product labeling, **Clip-in weight** means the total mass of the pilot plus harness plus all carried equipment (ballast, instruments, reserve), **excluding the glider**. 

This represents the operational loading a protector experiences during a crash.



### 3.3 Test Weight Range (wMin – wMax)

The certified range of test weights for which the protector has been evaluated. Both ends of the range are tested.

*   **wMin** Minimum certified Test Weight.
*   wMax Maximum certified Test Weight.



### 3.4 Weight Mapping

OPS2025 uses a provisional mapping between test weight and clip-in weight:


Test weight = 0.80 x Clip-in weight

> **Note**: This mapping is provisional. See Appendix B for discussion.



### 3.5 Maximum pilot height (hMax)
**hMax** is the maximum pilot height declared by the manufacturer, used to define coverage intent for the T12 region. OPS2025 does not (yet) define a physical verification method for hMax coverage (see Annex B).

### 3.6 Acceleration signal
OPS2025 uses the **single acceleration signal exported by the EN test equipment**. The internal sensor configuration is not constrained by OPS2025, but the exported acceleration channel must show:
- approximately **0 G at rest** (idle), and
- approximately **-1 G during free fall**,

independent of sensor orientation.

---

## 4. Classifications

OPS2025 defines two classifications:

| Classification | Description                              | Pre-warming Required |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **OPS2025-S**  | For protectors with single-use materials | No                   |
| **OPS2025-M**  | For protectors with multi-use materials  | Yes (5 drops)        |

The manufacturer selects the classification. A protector model must be certified under one classification only; dual certification is not permitted.

There is no material composition requirement for either classification. The distinction is procedural: -M protectors undergo a pre-warming stress test before measured drops.











### 4.2 Test matrix (measured drops)
Measured drops consist of:
- **3 impact points** (SB, M, T12),
- at **2 test weights** (wMin and wMax),

for a total of **6 measured drop conditions**.

---







## 5. Manufacturer declarations, labeling, and sample marking

### 5.1 Manufacturer declarations (required)
The manufacturer must declare:
- Test weight range: **wMin–wMax kg**.
- Maximum pilot height: **hMax**.

### 5.2 Consumer product labeling (required)
The consumer-facing label must include:

- Standard classification: **OPS2025-S** or **OPS2025-M**.
- **Test weight range**: wMin–wMax kg.
- **Recommended clip-in weight range** (derived using the mapping in Section 3.3).
- **Maximum pilot height**: hMax.

### 5.3 Certification sample marking (required)
The certification sample submitted to the lab must be marked on the **inner side** of the protector with:

- **PointSB**
- **PointT12** 
- PointM

and the manufacturer must provide enough information so the lab can mount the protector in the intended orientation.

_Production units do not require SB/M/T12 point markings._

---









## 6. Impact points

All points are on the protector’s **spine centerline** on the inner surface of the protector:

### 6.1 PointSB
PointSB is the classical EN-style sitting bone / sacral region impact point, as marked by the manufacturer.

### 6.2 PointT12
PointT12 is the impact point intended to represent the **T12 vertebra region** for the tallest supported pilot (hMax), as marked by the manufacturer.

### 6.3 PointM (derived)
PointM is derived to target the **L5–S1 region** without requiring an additional manufacturer-defined anatomical point.

 The midpoint, located one-third of the distance from PointSB toward PointT12, measured along the protector surface (curve-following)

Procedure to determine PointM:

1. Identify the manufacturer marks **SB** and **T12** on the inner side of the protector.
2. Draw a line on the protector surface from SB to T12 following the surface curvature (curve-following line).
3. Measure the distance **along this curve-following line** from SB to T12.
4. Mark **PointM** at **one-third** of this measured curved distance from SB toward T12.

Equivalent expression: **SB — 1/3 — M — 2/3 — T12**.

It may be marked by the manufacturer but the lab has to verify its correct location.







---

## 7. Test apparatus and setup

### 7.1 Apparatus
The test apparatus (dummy system, release mechanism, landing surface/anvil, and drop-height definition method) must be the same as used for the lab’s EN 1651:2020 impact pad test setup.

OPS2025 requires no modifications to the EN apparatus beyond dummy re-orientation and weight adjustment.



### 7.2 Drop height

Drop height must be **1.65 m**, using the lab’s EN 1651:2020 measurement method and tolerances.

### 7.3 Conditioning / environment
Samples must be conditioned per EN 1651:2020 requirements before testing.











## 8. Test procedure

### 8.1 Samples
- Certification uses **one physical protector sample**.
- For class M, the **same sample** must be used for pre-warming and all measured drops.

### 8.2 Pre-warming Stress Test (Class M only)
For **OPS2025-M** only:

- Perform **5 unmeasured drops** from 1.65 m at **wMax**.
- Configuration for these 5 drops:
  - Impact point: **PointSB**,
  - Dummy posture: **SB posture** (Section 8.3.1).
- Alignment requirements should match the measured drop alignment (to the extent practical).

No recovery time requirement is specified for pre-warming drops.

For **OPS2025-S**, this section is skipped.

### 8.3 Dummy postures and impact alignment (measured drops)

#### 8.3.1 SB posture (PointSB)
- Dummy posture: **EN 1651:2020 sitting posture**, with **22.5°** configuration (Thighs angled slightly upward, as used in EN impact pad tests).

#### 8.3.2 M posture (PointM)
- Dummy posture: torso/back plane at **45° to horizontal** (“eyes 45° up” posture).
- Impact alignment: impact centered on the derived M mark.

#### 8.3.3 T12 posture (PointT12)
- Dummy posture: **supine**, lying flat on the back, with the back plane **parallel to the ground**. Torso horizontal. Impact perpendicular to upper back.
- Impact alignment: impact centered on the T12 mark.

### 8.4 Measured drops required
For each declared test weight endpoint:

- Perform measured drops at **wMin** and **wMax** (tolerance ±2 kg at each endpoint).
- At each weight, perform measured drops at:
  - PointSB (SB posture),
  - PointM (M posture),
  - PointT12 (T12 posture).

Total: **6 measured drop conditions**.

### 8.5 Attempts per measured drop condition
For each of the 6 measured drop conditions:

- **One attempt** is normally performed.
- If needed, a **second attempt is permitted**.
- Attempts must be **consecutive** for that condition.
- The protector and/or mounting may be repositioned and straps retightened between attempts.
- **All attempts must be reported**, including failed ones

Invalid runs (equipment failure/sensor error) do not count towards the attempt limit and do not need to be reported.

### 8.6 Recovery time between measured drops
Between measured drops on the same sample, a recovery time of up to **1 hour maximum** is permitted. No minimum recovery time is specified.



---

## 9. Impact window definition (for peak evaluation)

OPS2025 evaluates peak acceleration and peak jerk during the **first impact event**.

### 9.1 Filtering prerequisite
The impact window is determined from the **filtered acceleration** (Annex A).

### 9.2 First impact window detection
- Find the first time the filtered acceleration exceeds **3 G**.
- Continue until the filtered acceleration returns below **3 G**.

Only the **first** such event is used.

### 9.3 Expanded analysis window
Define an expanded analysis window by extending:
- **100 ms before** the start crossing, and
- **100 ms after** the end crossing,

clipped to the available recorded data.

Peak acceleration and peak positive jerk must be evaluated within this expanded analysis window.

---



## 10. Pass/fail requirements

To achieve certification, **all 6 configurations** must meet the following criteria based on the filtered data.

### 10.1 Peak acceleration limit
- For each measured drop, the maximum filtered acceleration within the impact window must not exceed:

  **42 G**

### 10.2 Peak positive jerk limit
For each measured drop, the maximum filtered acceleration within the impact window must not exceed:



 J_LIMIT G/s



- Only **positive jerk** values are considered (jerk > 0).

**J_LIMIT is Work In Progress** and will be fixed as a single numeric value in the standard (Annex B).



### 10.3 Attempt logic for compliance

For each measured drop condition:
- If attempt 1 passes, the condition passes.
- If attempt 1 fails, attempt 2 may be performed.
- The condition passes if **either** attempt passes.
- The lab must still report both attempts.

Overall certification requires all **6 measured drop conditions** to pass by this rule.

---







## 11. Certification Report

The test laboratory must produce a certification report containing (at minimum):

### 11.1 Identification
- Manufacturer name
- Protector model name
- OPS2025 classification: **S or M**
- Declared test weight range: wMin–wMax kg
- Maximum pilot height: hMax

### 11.2 Environment and setup
- Date and location of test
- Environmental conditions (as recorded in the lab’s EN practice): temperature, humidity, pressure/altitude if available
- Drop height: 1.65 m (per EN method)

### 11.3 Instrumentation and data
- Sampling rate (Hz)

- Filter parameters used (Annex A), including:
  - low-pass cutoff frequency (150 Hz)

  - Savitzky–Golay window (23 ms)

    

### 11.4 Results (all attempts)
For each of the 6 measured drop conditions (SB/M/T12 × wMin/wMax), and for each attempt performed (including failed non-submitted attempts):

- Test weight used (kg)
- Impact point (SB, M, or T12)
- Dummy posture (SB 22.5°, M 45°, T12 supine)
- Peak filtered acceleration (G)
- Peak positive jerk (G/s)
- Pass/fail for the attempt

The report must clearly identify which attempt (if any) was used to demonstrate compliance for each condition.

# Annex A Measurement and signal processing (Normative): 

This appendix defines the mandatory signal processing for OPS2025 evaluation.

## A1. Sensor attachment and resonance control
Sensors must be attached firmly enough to avoid self-resonance artifacts.

- Metal-to-metal attachment is preferred.
- A sign of resonance is periodic oscillation visible in the jerk curve unrelated to impact dynamics.
- If resonance is present, the measurement is invalid and must be corrected mechanically (filtering cannot fix sensor self-resonance).



Recommended resonance checks (guidance):

1. With the dummy hanging (no drop), strike the dummy body with a small hammer at various points. Inspect the jerk signal for periodic oscillation.
1. Perform very low-height (a few centimeters) metal-to-ground drops and inspect for resonance in the jerk signal.

No amount of filtering can correct for a resonating sensor. If resonance is detected, improve the physical attachment before proceeding.





## A2. Sampling rate
- Minimum: 1000 Hz
- Constant sampling rate is required for filtering
- If the sensor produces variable-rate samples, the data must be resampled to a constant rate before filtering. (Resampling method is not specified by OPS2025.)

### A.4 Acceleration Filtering

The raw acceleration signal must be filtered using:

- **Filter type**: Butterworth low-pass
- **Application**: Zero-phase (forward-backward, e.g., `filtfilt`)
- **Order**: N=2 in the Butterworth design (resulting in 4th-order magnitude response when applied via filtfilt)
- **Cutoff frequency**: 150 Hz

This filter configuration is consistent with SAE J211 Channel Frequency Class methodology, adapted for digital implementation.

**Reference implementation (Python):**

```python
from scipy.signal import butter, filtfilt

def filter_acceleration(accel_array, sample_rate, cutoff_hz=150):
    b, a = butter(N=2, Wn=cutoff_hz, btype="low", fs=sample_rate)
    return filtfilt(b, a, accel_array)
```

### A.5 Jerk Calculation

Jerk is calculated as the time derivative of the **filtered acceleration signal** using a Savitzky–Golay derivative filter:

- **Polynomial order**: 3 (cubic)
- **Derivative order**: 1
- **Window size**: 23 ms (converted to samples based on sampling rate; adjusted to an odd integer number of samples)

The output jerk unit is **G/s** when the acceleration input is in G.

This filter computes a smoothed first derivative by fitting a cubic polynomial to data within the window, providing natural smoothing of the derivative.



**Reference implementation (Python):**

```python
from scipy.signal import savgol_filter

def compute_jerk(filtered_accel, sample_rate, window_ms=23):
    window_samples = int(round((window_ms / 1000) * sample_rate))
    if window_samples % 2 == 0:
        window_samples += 1

    jerk = savgol_filter(
        filtered_accel,
        window_length=window_samples,
        polyorder=3,
        deriv=1,
        delta=1.0 / sample_rate,
        mode='nearest'
    )
    return jerk
```

### 

## A5. Reported jerk value (positive only)
For OPS2025 evaluation:
- consider only **positive jerk** samples (jerk > 0),
- report **the maximum positive jerk** within the analysis window defined in Section 9.

- 

## A6. Definition of G

OPS2025 uses:

- **1 G = 9.80665 m/s².**

### A.7 Units

- Acceleration: G

- Jerk: G/s

# Appendix B: Work in Progress (WIP)

This appendix documents open items requiring further development before final standardization.

### 1\. **Jerk limit value (J_LIMIT)**

   The jerk acceptance limit is to be determined empirically by:

   1. Testing the **Kortel Kanibal Race 2** and **Ozone Exoceat** protectors
   1. At 75 kg test weight
   1. Using OPS2025 procedures and filtering
   1. Averaging the peak jerk values from both protectors

 This establishes the threshold based on protectors with established safety records at realistic pilot weights.

### 2\. **Point positioning tolerance / coverage verification**

Define tolerances for aligning impact to SB/M/T12 markings and define a method to verify that T12 is covered for hMax pilots.



### 0. T12 place coverage

Specs says: "impact centered on T12 mark". This needs to be specified, what centered means.

### 3. Test Configuration: Standalone vs. In-Harness

It remains undecided whether protectors should be tested:

- Standalone (attached directly to dummy)
- Installed in a harness
- Either configuration at manufacturer's choice

### B.2 Weight Mapping Refinement

The relationship between test weight and clip-in weight (Section 3.4) uses a factor of 0.80. This approximation requires validation across different harness configurations and pilot weight ranges.



### B.5 Weight Range Increments

Manufacturers may select any test weight range. Practical implementation depends on available calibrated weights at test facilities. Standardized weight classes may be considered.



### B.3 Dummy Weight Distribution

The current standard specifies total test weight but does not define how supplemental weights should be distributed on the dummy. This may affect impact dynamics and requires specification.



x. M point Angle:
Should it be horizontal compared to torso or leg part. If the test dummy is 90 degree then it doesn't matter, if it is non-90 degree, then it should be decided.



6\. **Pre-warming recovery time (Class M)**
   OPS2025 does not currently specify recovery timing between pre-warming drops.
