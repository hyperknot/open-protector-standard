## Consult with medical researchers

Verify that the new additional points are correct.



## T12 coverage

We need to specify what it means that the dummy is "covering" the T12 point. The point shouldn't be on the edge of the protector and this needs to be specified somehow.

Should we say it has to covered by at least 10 cm? Or should we simply ask for a higher vertebrae, like T7?



## Standalone vs. In-Harness

It remains undecided whether protectors should be tested:

- Standalone (attached directly to dummy)
- Installed in a harness
- Either configuration at manufacturer's choice



## Dummy Weight Distribution

The current standard specifies total test weight but does not define how supplemental weights should be distributed on the dummy. This may affect impact dynamics and requires specification.



## Posture Reference Angles

The 45° torso angle for LS posture should be clarified: whether it is measured relative to the torso plane or another reference.
