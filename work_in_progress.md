## B.2 Point Positioning and Coverage Verification

The following items require specification:

- Tolerances for aligning impact to SB/LS/T12 markings (what "centered" means precisely).

## B.3 Test Configuration: Standalone vs. In-Harness

It remains undecided whether protectors should be tested:

- Standalone (attached directly to dummy)
- Installed in a harness
- Either configuration at manufacturer's choice

## B.4 Weight Mapping Refinement

The relationship between test weight and clip-in weight (Section 3.4) uses a factor of 0.80. This approximation may require validation across different harness configurations and pilot weight ranges. The formula may be updated via errata without affecting certifications issued under test weight.

## B.5 Dummy Weight Distribution

The current standard specifies total test weight but does not define how supplemental weights should be distributed on the dummy. This may affect impact dynamics and requires specification.

## B.6 LS Posture Reference Angle

The 45° torso angle for LS posture should be clarified: whether it is measured relative to the torso plane or another reference. For 90° dummy configurations this distinction is immaterial, but it may matter for other configurations.
