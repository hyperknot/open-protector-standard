## Consult with medical researchers

Verify that the additional points are correct.

## T12 coverage

We need to specify what it means for the protector to "cover" the T12 point. The point shouldn't be on the edge of the protector, and this needs to be specified somehow.

Should we say it has to be covered by at least 10 cm? Or should we simply ask for a higher vertebra, like T7?

## Standalone vs. In-Harness

It remains undecided whether protectors should be tested:

- Standalone (attached directly to the dummy)
- Installed in a harness
- Either configuration at the manufacturer's choice

## Dummy Weight Distribution

The current standard specifies total test weight but does not define how supplemental weights should be distributed on the dummy. This may affect impact dynamics and requires specification.
