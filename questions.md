### Questions

#### What about Koroyd tubes rotating / not crumpling?

It should not be part of the standard. CIVL should have the right to suspend those harnesses where real-world behaviour differs from the one shown in test environment (aka Dieselgate).



#### Wouldn't heavy pilots need bigger protectors thus giving them aerodynamical disadvantage?

This might seem surprising, but heavier pilots don't actually need thicker protectors. They need a different protector material, like foam density in case of foam protectors. A protector certified for 50-60 kg could be equally thin as one certified for 100-120 kg.

What makes it thick is if it wants to cover a wide weight range, like 50-120 kg.

Interesting bit: the lower end of the weight range is critical for the jerk test, while the upper end is critical for the acceleration / G test.



#### What's the deal with the -S and -M classes? Who decides what does one harness get?

The -S and -M classes introduce distinction between single-use and multi-use protector materials.

CIVL and comp organizers should require given classes for given competitions, for example -M (multi-use) version should be required for XC Cat1 comps, where if a pilot crashes their protector on the first task, they cannot afford to fly 9 more tasks without protector.

The manufacturer decides what class does he want to submit a given model into.

H&F races might choose the -S (single use) version where a supporter can be expected to carry a spare protector in their car.



#### Can we test a harness's behaviour for higher impact velocities by testing with higher weights?

Unfortunately not. Even though a 50 kg weight dropped from 1.6 meters has the same energy (mgh) as a 100 kg weight dropped from 0.8 meters, their compression events will be very different.

Thus we cannot simulate for higher impact velocities by adding weights, we'll need to use drop test machines with bigger drop test heights.



### Isn't measuring jerk complicated and expensive?

No, it's not, it's available on the existing equipment, using the existing sensors and digital tools. It can be simply calculated using software tools on CSV files.

What can show up as error is self-resonance / ringing of badly attached sensors on the drop test equipment. But this part needs to be fixed anyway, as it can invalidate all kind of tests, not just jerk measurements.

The issue is usually physical attachment of the sensor, a super tight attachment is necessary for noise-free measurements. Ideal is metal-to-metal attachments.

When the sensor attachment is not tight enough, the sensor itself starts resonating after a drop and oscillating patters will be visible on the jerk graph. Fixing the sensor attachment can solve this problem.



### Isn't this expensive for small manufacturers?

This is only an additional test for those manufacturers who want to make racing harnesses for Cat1 and high level comps. Manufacturers not targeting this group are not affected.



### What about visibility?

Manufacturers say that adding protectors will make visibility worse. This supposes that every harness needs to have a perfectly circular cross section with a cigar-shape along the horizontal axis.

None of this is a rule set in stone, it's just easier to make harnesses like this. 3D shaping might be more complicated than uniform shapes, but we shouldn't believe that these rules are set in stone.

We used to have good visibility and good protectors.

This work now addresses the protectors. We can look into visibility in the next years. Many believe it can be solved even with thicker protectors.



### Who certifies it?

In the current form no one. The point of Open Protector Standard is that it can be adopted by CIVL, EN WG6, DHV or any other standard body.

So in practice, this could become CIVL Protector Standard and be certified like CCC gliders today.
